          <p>
            Just choose the packs you want to draft, hit "Create room" and copy
            the URL from your browser and share it with your friends! After
            joining any player can change their nickname at any time if they
            want to. I suggest not using BPM emotes in your nicknames, because
            the draft room page is not compatible with BPM. No, the world is not
            going to end if you use an emote in your nickname, but it will not
            work as might expect it to work.
          </p>
          <p>
            After everyone is in the room, you can press start game (if you are
            the creator of the room) to start the game. The room will be closed
            (no one will be able to join it after that), and everyone will
            recieve the cards from the first booster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then you can pick any of the presented cards. After you made your
            choice you have to wait for everyone to make their choice. You can
            see who already picked their card by circle indicator in the player
            list. If the circle is empty that means that that player haven't
            picked a card yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the draft process, you can see all the cards you drafted in
            the Pool section. You can export your Pool to PonyHead at any time
            by pressing "Export deck" button. That will open a link in a new tab
            (or window, depends on your browser preferences) with a deck on
            PonyHead with all the cards from your pool.
          </p>
          <p>
            After you finish the draft, just export your Pool to PonyHead and do
            whatever you want with it :)
